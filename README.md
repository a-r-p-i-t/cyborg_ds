## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict car prices based on various attributes. By training machine learning models on historical car data, we aim to create an accurate prediction tool that can assist both buyers and sellers in estimating car prices.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from `CarPrice_Assignment.csv`. It contains information about different car attributes such as make, model, engine specifications, and more.


## Usage

1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook `car_prediction.ipynb` to see the step-by-step process of data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

2. Modify the notebook or code files to experiment with different features, models, or data preprocessing techniques.

## Models

Several regression models are employed in this project, including:

- Linear Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Elastic Net
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- MLP Regressor
- XGBoost

Each model is trained and evaluated for its predictive performance.

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error. The best-performing model is determined based on these metrics.
